DATABASE:
---------
	is a collection of data stored in format that can be easily accessed 

DBMS:
-----
	 is used to access data they are ment for exceuting query to access data ,
	 then sent back the result 


We Have Several Database Management System 

relational Vs No-Relational
------------------------------- 

1) relational Databases
----------------------
	 	ih Relational database we use to store the data  into  tables that are linked 			together. thats why we called relational 

Some OF DBMS are 
--------------------
	- SQl server 
	- MYSQL 
	- oracle 

2) No-Relational 
----------------
Non Relational Database we don't have  relational  that are linked together 

some of No-Sql are : 
------------------
Mongodb 



commands 
---------
- show databases : shows  all databases 

- use database dbname  : uses or selects a database for you

select * from customer  : fetching all data from customer table 

select * from customer where customer_id  = 2; 

filtering data that is returned from the table 




column specefying vs * 

column specifying has one advantage 
when you have alot of records it will take some time to fetch it so at that time we use column secifying  


* :  fetchs all data from table


Distnicts
-------- : return the unique values means it terminates the duplicates 


in SQL When we specify the where cluase  
sql will iterate all data  and check the condition of where caluse  then if  true it return  to the result set and if not it ignres or not will reutrn
